## Admin Routes

Protected at `/admin/*` — login required.

Dashboard, Pages, Services, Service Areas, Fleet, Gallery, Testimonials, FAQs, Pricing, Blog, Bookings, Quotes, Payments, Inquiries, Settings.

---

## Logo & Brand Assets

The client-supplied SierraLink logo (shield with **SL** monogram) is at:

```
public/uploads/settings/sierralink-logo.png
```

Replace via **Admin → Settings** upload. The cinematic intro, header, and footer all use this asset.

**Brand palette:** Obsidian `#060807`, Antique Gold `#AC9461`, Signature Gold `#D0AF6F`, Ivory `#F5EFE5`

---

## Local Media Uploads

All media is stored locally under `public/uploads/`:

```
public/uploads/
  pages/  services/  service-areas/  fleet/
  gallery/  testimonials/  blogs/  settings/
```

**Deployment note:** Local filesystem uploads require **persistent disk** on your Node/VPS host. Ephemeral serverless filesystems (e.g. default Vercel) will lose uploads on redeploy unless you attach persistent volume storage.

Do **not** use Cloudinary, S3, or other hosted media platforms — local uploads are required by project scope.

**Backup:** Include `public/uploads/` in your deployment backup strategy alongside MongoDB.

---

## Demo Images

Branded SVG placeholders live in `public/images/demo/`. Replace with licensed professional photography before launch:

- Black luxury sedan/SUV exteriors and interiors
- Airport curbside scenes (ALB, JFK)
- Executive pickup moments
- Capital Region travel scenery

Demo fleet and gallery records are seeded **unpublished** until replaced with verified SierraLink photography.

---

## MongoDB

Database name: **`sierralink_transportation`**

View in Compass: connect to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` → select `sierralink_transportation`.

**Backup:**
```bash
mongodump --db sierralink_transportation --out ./backup
```

---

## Stripe Payments (Optional)

When disabled (default), bookings and manual quotes work fully. Customers see: *"Payment link will be provided after your ride is confirmed."*

To enable:

1. Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account
2. Set in `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true
   ```
3. Configure webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Enable payments in **Admin → Pricing**

**Flow:** Admin creates quote on booking → generates secure link → customer accepts → Stripe Checkout (amount from DB, never client) → webhook confirms payment.

Admin **cannot** manually mark a payment as Paid — status comes from verified Stripe webhooks only.

---

## Email (Optional)

Set SMTP credentials in `.env` to send quote/payment links by email. When unavailable, copy links from **Admin → Bookings → [id]**.

The app never claims an email was sent unless delivery actually succeeded.

---

## Google Maps Autocomplete (Optional)

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to enable address autocomplete. Booking works with plain text fields when disabled.

---

## Google Search Console & Local SEO

1. Deploy site and verify domain in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Submit sitemap: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Test structured data: [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
4. **Google Business Profile** (owner must complete):
   - Correct business name, category (Chauffeur/Limousine service)
   - Phone numbers, service areas, website URL
   - Hours and address only when verified
   - Real photos and genuine reviews

Structured data includes LocalBusiness, Service, BreadcrumbList, and FAQ schema **only with verified fields** — no fake ratings or unverified claims.
